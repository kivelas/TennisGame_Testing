# TennisGame_Testing
TennisGame task implementation for unit test practice

This task was part of the Software Quality and Testing course.

What I learned/what did I do:
  This was the first time I wrote any kind of unit tests, so I learned a lot about them. The code may still have bugs in it, but I fixed some obvious ones.
  The IDE used in this task was Eclipse and the unit tests were done using JUnit. The tests are written so that the source code's lines are covered, i.e. white-box testing was
  the used approach.
